## üìñ Documentation

### Overview

Cosmos-Predict2 serves as a versatile framework for developing world models that can adapt to various Physical AI tasks. The models are built to be robust, efficient, and easily customizable. 

### Key Features

- **General-Purpose Models**: These models are designed to handle a variety of tasks without the need for extensive modifications.
- **Fine-Tuning Capability**: You can easily fine-tune the models to suit specific applications.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The framework is designed to be intuitive, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced users.

### Model Architecture

The models in Cosmos-Predict2 utilize state-of-the-art architectures that are proven to perform well in various scenarios. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the architecture:

- **Input Layer**: Accepts data in various formats.
- **Hidden Layers**: Multiple layers that process the input and extract features.
- **Output Layer**: Provides predictions based on the processed data.

### Example Usage

Here‚Äôs a simple example to demonstrate how to use Cosmos-Predict2:

```python
from cosmos_predict2 import Model

# Initialize the model
model = Model()

# Load your data
data = model.load_data('path/to/your/data')

# Fine-tune the model
model.fine_tune(data)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
print(predictions)
```

## üìä Performance Metrics

The performance of the models can be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Below is a sample of how to evaluate your model:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Assume y_true and y_pred are your true and predicted values
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
```
